********************************************************************************
How To generate the API doc and tutorials (made with phpDocumentor 1.2.3)
********************************************************************************
Guide is based on "HTML:frames:DOM/earthli" converter

----
First you need to hack a little phpDocumentor converters options.ini file.
(PEAR\data\PhpDocumentor\phpDocumentor\Converters\HTML\frames\templates\DOM\earthli\options.ini)

In [ppage] section of options.ini, 
# adds:
	graphic = img
	graphic->fileref = src
	graphic/ = 
  to allow display of images (progress screenshots).

# adds:
	tip = <div class="tips">
	/tip = </div>
  to allow display of tips area
  
At end of options.ini file,
# adds:
	[tip_title]
	;tag_attr = true
	;attr_name = true
	cdata_start = true
	open = <img src="../media/tip.gif" />
	close = 
  if you want to have the little icon on left corner

----
Second you need to hack a little phpDocumentor converters stylesheet file.
(PEAR\data\PhpDocumentor\phpDocumentor\Converters\HTML\frames\templates\DOM\earthli\templates\media\stylesheet.css)

# adds:
	.tips { padding: 0.5em; margin-left: 2em; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt; background-color: lightyellow; color: black; width: 80%;}
  for Tips display

----
Finally, you have to run phpdoc (or perharps docBuilder - Webinterface):
 	phpdoc [commandline]
 	
where command_line switches are :
	-f <pathTo>HTML\Progress.php                               to parse main file
	-d <pathTo>HTML\Progress,<pathTo>HTML\Progress\tutorials   to parse all subclasses and tutorial files
        -po HTML_Progress                                          to restrict generation to HTML_Progress, NOT included Error_Raise
        -o <you favorite output format>                            for example "HTML:frames:DOM/earthli"
        -t <target directory>                                      where you want to put generated files
