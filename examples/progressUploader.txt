             ----------------------------

An example of frontend solution to use the class HTML_Progress_Uploader
of the package HTML_Progress.

The HTML_Progress_Uploader class provides a GUI interface
(with progress bar) to manage files to upload to a 
ftp server via your web browser.
But it does not provides a full GUI interface to select
the files to move on the ftp server.


Requirements:
=*=*=*=*=*=*=
- PHP 4.3.0 or greater
- ftp loaded extension 


Dependencies:
=*=*=*=*=*=*=
- HTML_QuickForm 3.1.1 or greater              http://pear.php.net/HTML_QuickForm


Files contents:
=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=
- uploader1.php     the QuickForm GUI to select files to upload
- uploader2.php     the QuickForm GUI to show progress bar pending file upload operation
- form_output.php   the GUI form output renders (colors, sizes ...)


How its works:
=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Point your web browser to first page 'uploader1.php'. It will display 
a dialog box with 10 choices to select file. 
It you want more or less choice, edit file 'uploader1.php' at line 18.

When you've selected all your files, clic on 'Submit' button to validate
the form.
On the user-callback 'myProcess' function, only not empty file entry are 
wrote on a session. Then a redirection to file 'uploader2.php' show the
progress bar, and wait your order yo upload the files to the ftp server.

Clic on 'Upload' to begin process. It will stop at end of files move, and 
display the message "All files were move on to {your_server}" if all was ok.

Valid extension file are given at line 44 of file 'uploader2.php'.
By default, only extensions below are allowed:
'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png', 'pdf', 'tar', 'zip', 'gz'

Your FTP account (user, password, hostname) should be filled and valid
at line 15 of file 'uploader2.php'.
The server destination directory should exists, and have rights to write,
because HTML_Progress_Uploader won't create it.

The process begin when user clic on 'Upload' button, then (on file uploader2.php) :
- setFiles() (line 82) declare all files to move on server
- logon() (line 85) we will connect to server: $ftp['host'] and login as user: $ftp['user']
- moveTo() (line 93) move each file and display an indeterminate progress bar

When transfer is completed, then :
- logoff() (line 109) disconnect from ftp server
- remove all session datas (lines 111, 112) 


You want to change the dialog box and progress bar presentation:
=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
To change color and size pattern for both forms, edit file 'form_output.php'.
The progress bar graphical attributes are locate on file 'uploader2.php' at lines 38, 39, 40.
